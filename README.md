# HW2-ResponsivePortfolio

In this project, I made my first attempt at creating a personal site that is responsive so that it can be viewed fluidly while on a laptop, tablet, and small screen 
device like cell phones.

For practice, I made this page as a basic portfolio of my skills, just like a resume but as a webpage. 

The main part of this assignment was to learn how to properly incorporate and use Bootstrap elements in our HTML site. Examples of what i used are cards,
and navbar, and form elements on different pages.
